Hey there! :blush:
You would describe yourself as lazy? Performing the same task twice makes you cringe? You have come to the right blog. I'm a system engineer from Frankfurt (Germany) mostly focused on Microsoft products. Over the years I have developed a good idea how to automate common IT processes and I'm happy to share that with you.
